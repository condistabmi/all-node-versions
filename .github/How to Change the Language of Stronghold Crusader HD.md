## GOG Version
 
If you bought the game on GOG, you can change the language from either the in-game options menu or the GOG Galaxy client. Here are the steps:

## Patch Version
 
If you have an older version of Stronghold Crusader HD that does not support changing languages from Steam or GOG, you can download a patch that adds English language support. Here are the steps:

3. Run Stronghold\_Crusader\_Extreme.exe or Stronghold\_Crusader.exe depending on which version of the game you have.
4. Select English from the options menu.
5. Launch the game and enjoy!

Please note: This patch only works for Stronghold Crusader HD version 1.4. It may not be compatible with other versions or mods of the game.[^2^]
  
## Other Options
 
If none of the above methods work for you, or if you want to play the game in a language that is not officially supported, you may have to look for other options. Here are some of them:

- You can try to find a fan-made translation or mod that adds your desired language to the game. For example, there is a mod called Stronghold Europe that adds European languages and features to Stronghold Crusader HD. You can download it from this link: [https://www.moddb.com/mods/stronghold-europe/downloads/stronghold-europe-english-patch](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stronghold-europe/downloads/stronghold-europe-english-patch). However, be careful when installing unofficial mods or patches, as they may contain viruses or malware, or cause compatibility issues with the game.
- You can try to use a third-party software or tool that changes the language of the game on the fly. For example, there is a video tutorial on YouTube that shows how to change the language of Stronghold Crusader HD using a program called Language Changer. You can watch it from this link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA4hWOtLUZ4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA4hWOtLUZ4). However, be careful when downloading or using unknown software or tools, as they may contain viruses or malware, or cause performance issues with the game.
- You can try to learn the language of the game by playing it. This may sound challenging, but it can also be fun and rewarding. You can use online dictionaries, translators, or guides to help you understand the game's interface, menus, and dialogues. You can also use subtitles or captions if available. You may find that playing the game in a different language enhances your immersion and enjoyment of the game.
